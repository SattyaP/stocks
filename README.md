# 📦 Stocks — Warehouse Management System

**Stocks** is a warehouse management system designed to help businesses track, manage, and organize inventory with ease. It provides core features to handle stock movements, supplier management, and stock level monitoring — enabling efficient and transparent inventory control.

## 🚀 Version 2 (v2) — What's New?

The second major version of **Stocks** is a complete rework of the original application, now built with **Laravel Livewire** and **Alpine.js**. These modern tools bring a more dynamic and responsive user experience while maintaining the simplicity and robustness of the Laravel backend.

| Feature | v1 (Legacy) | v2 (Current) |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Framework | Laravel (Blade only) | Laravel + Livewire + Alpine.js |
| Interactivity | Page reloads on actions | Real-time interactivity with Livewire |
| UI Responsiveness | Traditional form-submits | Reactive components (modals, inline updates, validation) |
| Scalability | Static page logic | Modular Livewire components |
| Dev Experience | Basic Blade templating | Enhanced reactivity with Livewire/Alpine |
